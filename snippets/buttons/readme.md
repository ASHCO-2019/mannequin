# Buttons

The button snippets here are primarily for FPO uses, and are styled in the UWAA "Boundless Button" style.  

CSS Support in e-mail is extremely limited, so your safest best is the creation of a image with your button style (don't forget alt text).

UW-style buttons for the web are illustrated on the (UW Brand Portal)[http://www.washington.edu/brand/web-2/html-web-components/]. 

## Notes
* Our buttons are 180 pixels wide.
* Buttons for two-column layouts have different markup than full-width layouts.
* Buttons on a purple background should have an anti-aliasing mask made to make the boundless angle not appear jagged.
